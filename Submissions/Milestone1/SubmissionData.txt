Create a git repository on github.com and inform the TA. 
Place on that repository the code you found and/or wrote for a single-user version of your game.


Our git repo can be found at: https://github.com/foreza/168werewolf


Submit on EEE Dropbox, one per team, the "final" version of your requirements document. (Submitted by Connor)

Additionally, include a high level architecture of the source code you wrote/found. You should know what each file/class/method is for (even if you donâ€™t yet grasp all the details of its inner working). 
The high level architecture description can be textual and/or diagram-based.


Big Components:

Player, Environment, Enemies, Objectives, GlobalGameState

The Player has 3 primary modules 
- Vision (interacts with environment and enemies)
- Interaction (interacts with objectives and environment)
- Controller (Allows player to control character)

Environment has 2 primary modules
- Fog of war system (cannot be seen unless near a player)
- Collision handling/rendering

Enemies have 3 primary modules
- Fog of war system
- Collision handling/rendering
- Player following (and eventually combat)

Objectives have 2 primary modules
- Interactable (with the player)
- Communication with both player and Global game state

GlobalGameState has 3 primary states.
- 1) Haven Inactive (aka the two towers have not been activated)
- 2) Haven Active (countdown begin, all players need to reach exit)
- 3) Game Over (countdown finish, players either win or lose)
